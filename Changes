0.133   2021-11-24  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- [bugfix] Previous commit to work better with ColorTheme::NoColor was

0.132   2021-11-23  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Work better when using ColorTheme::NoColor (don't emit ANSI reset
	  because there's no ANSI color set, avoid perl undef warning)
	  (RT#140117, reported by Kevin Van Workum).

	- Observe object's TO_JSON() (thanks Kevin Van Workum, RT #140118).

        - Rename color theme modules to be more compliant with ColorTheme v2
          (all modules are named under ColorTheme:: namespace). But allow
          searching using ColorTheme:: as well as ColorTheme::JSON::Color::
          prefixes.
